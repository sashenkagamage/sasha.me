# Hi there, I'm Sashenka! 👋

Welcome to my world of robots, algorithms, and endless possibilities! I'm a final year undergraduate student with a passion for creating autonomous robots that push the boundaries of what's possible. My journey in robotics began with a curiosity about how machines can interact with the world, and it has evolved into a quest to make them smarter, faster, and more autonomous.

With a strong foundation in Python and C++, I dive deep into the world of Robot Operating Systems (ROS) and cutting-edge technologies to bring my projects to life. Whether it’s building autonomous robots, developing complex AI algorithms, or using computer vision for real-time decision-making, I’m all in for challenges that blend software with hardware.

As I prepare for my Master's in Robotics, I'm eager to take on bigger projects and collaborate with others who share my excitement for creating the next generation of intelligent systems.

Let's build something that moves, learns, and grows!

### 🤖 Why Robotics?
Robotics has always fascinated me because it combines hardware and software to solve real-world problems. There's something magical about seeing a robot come to life and perform tasks autonomously. It's this mix of creativity, engineering, and AI that keeps me constantly learning and building.
