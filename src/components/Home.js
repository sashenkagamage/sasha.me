               Hi! I am Sashenka Gamage, a junior studying Electronics Engineering at <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>. I am currently working on 
               autonomous navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and ROS (Robot Operating Systems). My interests rely on Robotics, UAVs, and IoT systems.
               If you are a robotics geek feel free to hit me up!
               </p>
               <p>
               I am also a <a href="https://www.millenniumfellows.org/class-of-2024-fellows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UN Millennium Fellow</a> who is aiming to work on reducing the gender disparity in STEM fields. My project "Wall-E from Ohm World" will be released 
               soon, where my goal is to provide educational materials related to electronics and robotics projects for students in developing countries. </p>
                <p>I have a habit of trying out new methods, while improving myself and correcting my mistakes eagerly. 
                With all my passions, my main intention is to share and use my knowledge and experiences for the betterment of humankind
